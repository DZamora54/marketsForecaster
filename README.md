This project was made to solve the problem of interested parties at an investment management firm not knowing what local market accounts would be available for a fund launch.

Using this tool allows for individuals to self serve and find out if necessary markets will be available for a fund launch. This information allows for decision makers to determine if an original targeted launch date can be met or if the launch date must be moved to include required markets.

This was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Some of the things I learned working on this project included implementing functionality for downloading data from the website as Excel and CSV files and working with functions to calculate for adding business days to a date and finding the time difference between dates saved as strings in different formats.
